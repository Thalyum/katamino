# This game requires the player to fill a 11x5 grid with predefined geometric
# pieces
# Each piece will fit in a 4x4 square (meaning will be at most 4-unit wide
# and/or 4-unit tall)
# Each piece will be at least 1-unit wide or tall

# placement (instead of doing some intricate computation over the array

# of our 'piece-matrix', we can have some issues with the far right and bottom
# checking.
